# dabf

Powerful framework for building Discord bots (potentially other platforms later)

Documentation coming soonTM. Library is still a work in progress (expect breaking changes!). Example usage can be found [here](https://github.com/jellz/warzone-stats).

DABF has been live in production for the last few months on [Warzone Stats](https://github.com/jellz/warzone-stats) but the framework hasn't been on GitHub until now.
